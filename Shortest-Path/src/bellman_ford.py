    Execute the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest paths.
    
    The Bellman-Ford algorithm finds shortest paths from a source vertex to all
    other vertices in a weighted graph. Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, it can handle
    graphs with negative edge weights and detect negative cycles.
    
    The algorithm works by relaxing all edges repeatedly. After V-1 iterations,
    if no further improvements can be made, the algorithm has found the shortest
    paths. If improvements can still be made in the V-th iteration, there exists
    a negative cycle.
