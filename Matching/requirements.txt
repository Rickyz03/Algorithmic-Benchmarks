# Bipartite Graph Matching Algorithms - Requirements
# Core dependencies for running the matching algorithms project

# Numerical computing
numpy>=1.21.0

# Visualization and plotting
matplotlib>=3.5.0

# Optional: Enhanced testing capabilities
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0

# Standard library extensions (usually included, but listed for completeness)
# typing_extensions>=4.0.0  # Only needed for Python < 3.8

# Development and code quality (optional)
black>=22.0.0
flake8>=5.0.0
mypy>=0.991

# Documentation generation (optional)
# sphinx>=5.0.0
# sphinx-rtd-theme>=1.0.0

# Note: This project is designed to work with minimal dependencies
# The core algorithms only require Python standard library + numpy + matplotlib


# Maximum Python version compatibility: 
# Latest, even 3.13 works
