# Advanced Data Structures Project

This project implements and compares three fundamental advanced data structures used in competitive programming and algorithm optimization:

- **Segment Tree**: Efficient range queries and point updates
- **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**: Optimized prefix sum operations
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**: Dynamic connectivity queries

## Project Goals

The main objectives are to:
1. Implement these data structures from scratch
2. Create enhanced variants with advanced optimizations
3. Benchmark and compare their performance characteristics
4. Analyze their practical applications and trade-offs

## Structure

- `data-structures/`: Basic implementations
- `variants/`: Enhanced versions with optimizations
- `tests/`: Correctness verification
- `benchmarks/`: Performance comparison tools
- `main.py`: Main execution script
- `report.typ`: Comprehensive analysis report

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Implementation and testing
- **Typst**: Technical report generation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Performance visualization

## Running the Project

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

This will run all tests, benchmarks, and generate performance comparisons.
